Cooling, power series, optics, alchemy, planetary motions, apples.

## Experience
`2017-Now|La Défense, FR`
__Société Générale, Risk Departement Datalab.__
   - Key responsibilities:  
    - Work closely with internal clients across business lines to design data science solution to facilitate decision making and increase effectivity.  
    - Contributor for Data science communities, internship tutor.
   - Featured projects:  
    - **Regime switches** : allow to detect weak signals of trading desk behaviour changes. Help financial analysts to do better clients portfolio monitoring.
    - **Data Preprocessing**: develop an API of advanced data cleaning and denoising techniques: imputation of missing values, and detection of outlier values for quantitative analyst. Save more than 50% of time for data preprocessing.  
    - **Counter-party Risk Exposure Clustering**: identify key risk factors affecting counter-party risk metrics. ML models: spectral clustering, Shared Nearest Neighbour distance. Allowed reducing related word-load by 30\%.  
   - R\&D projects:  
    - **NLP for Negative News**: deep learning models for sentiment analysis: word embeding, CNN, RNN, LSTM, transfer learning.
    - **Machine Learning Models Explanation**: develop relevant indicators for model interpretation and potential explanation to regulator.
    - **Neural Networks Architecture Optimisation**: automatically search optimal NN architecture. Key words : Reinforcement learning with policy descent gradient, shared-weights NN.
