##### France have hosted the Olympic Games twice, 1900 and 1924. After a century of waiting, it's official !. Paris will once again be hosting the summer Olympic Games.
 
For this historic event, let look back on the France record at the previous 2016 Olympic Games in Rio, Brazil, and its evolution from the beginning of the Olympic Games.  
These graphs in this blog were made with [*Bokeh*](https://bokeh.org/) an open source library of Python for data visualization.  
 
The used dataset is a historical record of the modern Olympic Games, including all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016.

Here's some inline code `x+y`.


Here's some math:

$$z=x+y$$

You can also put it inline $$z=x+y$$
