Here's some basic text.

And here's some *italics*

Here's some **bold** text.

What about a [link](https://github.com/dataoptimal)?

Here's a bulleted list:
* First item
+ Second item
- Third item

Here's a numbered list:
1. First
2. Second
3. Third

Python code block:
```python
    import numpy as np

    def test_function(x, y):
      z = np.sum(x,y)
      return z
```


Here's an exmple of Bokeh:
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/olympic/olympic.gif"  width="1000"/>
Here's some inline code `x+y`.

{% include Olympic/record_fr.html %}

Here's some math:

$$z=x+y$$

You can also put it inline $$z=x+y$$
