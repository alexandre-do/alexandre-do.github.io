### [Extract support phrases for sentiment analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tweet-sentiment-extraction) is one data science competition hosted by Kaggle in May 2020.   
##### Every second, on average, around 6,000 tweets are tweeted on Twitter , which corresponds to  around 200 billion tweets per year. The sentiment behind every tweet has a big impact on the third party - a subject of the tweet because of millions interactions. The brand can run down a profit because of fake news or something can become easily popular for being viral. 
#####  So capturing sentiment in language is really important in these times where decisions and reactions are created and updated in seconds. But, which words actually lead to the sentiment description? In this competition, the participants have to build a model that picks out the part of the tweet (word or phrase) that reflects the sentiment.
